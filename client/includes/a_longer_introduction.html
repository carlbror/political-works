                    <i>The purpose of theBestPoliticalWorks is to be a hub for finding the most relevant political literature, and other
                    media, for knowing whether a particular political ideology or question is good or bad. It will thereby (hopefully)
                    make it easier to get involved in and get a better understanding of politics.</i>

                <h6>Finding the best works in politics</h6>
                <p>
                    To make an informed choice in politics one needs to have thought through some questions of morality
                    - what is right, and what is wrong - and to have a good understanding of how societies function. There
                    seems to be two basic questions then: what values are correct and what is the best explanation of how we
                    behave and interact?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Answers to these questions have been summed up in
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_ideologies"> political ideologies</a>; systems
                    of thought that both advocate some beliefs on how we actually do interact and some ideas on how we should
                    interact, plus ideas on how to implement their policies. The question above could then be reformulated
                    as: which - of all existing, dead, and not yet thought of - ideology is the correct one?
                </p>

                <p>
                    To reach an answer to this (or these, depending on how you think about it) fundamental political question(s),
                    it is necessary to think and study the world. Doing it independently might take too long, though, so
                    it is probably best to reason with the help of studies and thought-experiments others have done. But,
                    even when reading what others have written, there is a huge amount of research that one needs to wade
                    through. How then to decide what to read (or watch, experience) and what not to read?
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is where theBestPoliticalWorks enters. It lets users share their reviews of how good they think a particular
                    work is in promoting or demoting an ideology. The first purpose I had for the site was to let people
                    name one book or article that was best at explaining why their most preferred ideology was the best.
                    This is still the central purpose, but now one can also add movies, lectures, or games, and one can
                    share reviews of works for a particular policy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thus, the essential problem that theBestPoliticalWorks tries to solve is this one: "If I want to understand
                    a particular ideology (which requires something like reading at least one book on the subject), what
                    <i>one</i> source of information should I invest my time in? To get to know as much as possible about
                    an issue, what work is the best?" Other problems it solves is what particular media is most readable,
                    convincing, or has the best explanations, in showing why a policy or ideology is good/bad.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are other sites that perform a similar function such as the articles on
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_ideologies">Wikipedia</a>, or other encyclopedias,
                    that link to articles and books written by some of the greatest defenders of that ideology. These sites
                    does however suffer from not displaying <i>all</i> works from <i>anyone</i> that someone finds to be
                    noteworthy, and by not ranking the articles according to the preferences of those who have read them;
                    theBestPoliticalWorks does both plus it also lets you show your own recommendations. It should also more easily
                    let others become aware of new works.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, theBestPoliticalWorks is a site where you can (hopefully) find <i>the best</i> work (literature, movie,
                    sound, game) to describe why a certain political course is good or bad. In the future, some extra features,
                    will be added - like recommending a work to prove why another work is good/bad, proving you've read/watched
                    a work, and getting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_badges">badges</a> for having read/watched
                    others works.
