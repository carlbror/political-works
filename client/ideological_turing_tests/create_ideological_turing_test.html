            Ideological Turing Tests</a> are conducted to test if someone with an ideology can fool others into
            believing
            he or she believes in something she doesn't.

        <p>
            There are a few variants of the Ideological Turing Test. Here you can create tests where someone might
            answer
            questions on only others ideology or both others and his/her own ideology.
        </p>

        <p>
            What ideology does the one/those you want to test adhere to?
        </p>
        <input type="text" class="test-directed-towards ideologies necessary">


        <p>
            What ideology should they be tested on?
        </p>
        <input type="text" class="ideology-tested-on ideologies necessary">

        <p>
            Should the test be reciprocal, should the latter group also be tested on how well they can disguise themselves
            as members of the first group?
            <label class="reciprocal-test" for="reciprocal-test-checkbox">
                <input type="checkbox" id="reciprocal-test-checkbox"> Yes?
            </label>
        </p>

        <p>Write the questions for the first group:</p>
        <div class="textarea-container" id="first-ideology-group-questions">
            <textarea rows="3" cols="50" class="necessary"></textarea> <i class="fa fa-plus-circle up"></i> <i class="fa fa-minus-circle down"></i>
        </div>

        {{#if twoWayTest}}
        <p>Write the questions for the second group:</p>
        <div class="textarea-container" id="second-ideology-group-questions">
            <textarea rows="3" cols="50"></textarea> <i class="fa fa-plus-circle up"></i> <i class="fa fa-minus-circle down"></i>
        </div>
        {{/if}}

        <p>
            How many can take part of the test? (Leave empty or write 0 for allowing as many as possible to take part.)
        </p>

        <input type="number" min="0" class="number-of-allowed-contestants">

        <p>
            Is there a last date to answer the question? (Leave empty to decide later whenever it should be finished.)

        <input id="last-date-to-answer" class="datepicker"  name="date">

        <p>
            Is there a last date for others to guess what ideology the contestants belong to?
            (Leave empty to decide whenever it should be finished.)
